**My projects:**

 1. **Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression**
 2. **Salary Dataset - Linear Regression**
 3. **The Android App Market on Google Play**


## 1. Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains two columns Hours and Scores. Linear regression very effective used to predict the scores based on the number of hours.
## 2. Salary Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains three columns: "Unnamed: 0",	"YearsExperience",	"Salary". A model was created that predicts the amount of earnings depending on the years of experience. In the first stages, the data was analyzed and cleaned, and the data for model creation was prepared. The model was then built using linear regression and transformation trials were used to improve it. At the final stage, a model was created using statsmodels. 
## 3. The Android App Market on Google Play
**Content:**
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
