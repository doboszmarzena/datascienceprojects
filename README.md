**My projects:**

 1. **Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression**
 2. **Salary Dataset - Linear Regression**


## 1. Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains two columns Hours and Scores. Linear regression very effective used to predict the scores based on the number of hours.
## 2. Salary Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains three columns: "Unnamed: 0",	"YearsExperience",	"Salary". A model was created that predicts the amount of earnings depending on the years of experience. In the first stages, the data was analyzed and cleaned, and the data for model creation was prepared. The model was then built using linear regression and transformation trials were used to improve it. At the final stage, a model was created using statsmodels.
