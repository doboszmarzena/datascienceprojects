 1. **Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression**
 2. **Salary Dataset - Linear Regression**
 3. **The Android App Market on Google Play**
 4. **A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners**


## 1. Students Score Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains two columns Hours and Scores. Linear regression very effective used to predict the scores based on the number of hours.
## 2. Salary Dataset - Linear Regression
**Content:**
This contains three columns: "Unnamed: 0",	"YearsExperience",	"Salary". A model was created that predicts the amount of earnings depending on the years of experience. In the first stages, the data was analyzed and cleaned, and the data for model creation was prepared. The model was then built using linear regression and transformation trials were used to improve it. At the final stage, a model was created using statsmodels. 
## 3. The Android App Market on Google Play
**Content:**
Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.
## 4. A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners
**Content:**
The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?
Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. The aim of the project is to analyze data in terms of the nationality, gender of the winners and the categories of awards granted. Questions about the average age at which the prize was awarded in a given category and the oldest and youngest Nobel Prize winner were also answered.
